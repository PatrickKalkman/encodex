Got it. I’ll look into whether static encoding settings and brute-force testing (using VMAF or similar quality metrics across multiple encodes) are indeed widely used in the video streaming industry today. I’ll get back to you shortly with a breakdown of current industry practices and which methods are most commonly adopted.

# Static vs Per-Title (“Brute-Force”) Video Encoding in Streaming Platforms

## Static Encoding Settings (One-Size-Fits-All)
**Description:** A *static encoding* approach uses the same encoding parameters (codec settings, resolutions, bitrates) for all video content, regardless of complexity. This typically means using a fixed *bitrate ladder* (a set of resolution-bitrate pairs) applied uniformly to every title. Historically, this one-size-fits-all method was common – for example, early on Netflix used a fixed ladder for its entire catalog ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9Cone,specified%20by%20the%20ladder%20above)). Many broadcasters and streaming services initially relied on such static recipes, often based on industry recommendations (e.g. Apple’s HLS ladder), to simplify deployment. 

**Who Uses It:** Static ladders were the norm in the early days of streaming and are *still used* in some scenarios today. Smaller OTT services or those without advanced transcoding workflows may stick to fixed encoding settings for simplicity. It’s also common in live streaming, where there isn’t time for complex per-title analysis – live encoders often output a predetermined set of streams. Many companies have found static ladders “easy to implement” but acknowledge this approach results in *inefficient use of storage and suboptimal quality* for some content ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=How%20many%20renditions%20should%20you,usage%20of%20your%20video%20content)). Recent survey data shows a significant portion of the industry has *not yet adopted* content-adaptive encoding (around 37.8% have no plans for per-title encoding), implying they continue to use static ladders for now ([Bitmovin Video Developer Report Reveals Streaming in 2025: Incremental Growth Over Innovation - Streaming Learning Center](https://streaminglearningcenter.com/learning/bitmovin-report-reveals-streaming-in-2025-incremental-growth-over-innovation.html#:~:text=The%20Report%20shows%20that%2025.5,a%20divide%20in%20the%20industry)).

**Advantages:** Static encoding is straightforward. There’s no upfront content analysis needed – each video is encoded once per rendition, which keeps processing simple and fast. This yields predictable file sizes and bitrates, making capacity planning easier. The pipeline is easier to maintain, and encoding presets don’t need to change per asset. In resource-constrained environments or live streams, static settings ensure quick turnaround and consistency.

**Drawbacks:** The one-size-fits-all strategy is *inefficient for diverse content*. Complex, high-motion videos may suffer because the fixed bitrate might be too low for them, causing quality loss (blockiness or blur), while very simple content (cartoons, talk shows) could have been encoded at a much lower bitrate without quality loss ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9Cone,specified%20by%20the%20ladder%20above)) ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=8000%20kbps%20or%20more%20to,acceptable%20PSNR%20of%2038%20dB)). In other words, a static ladder must be tuned high enough to handle the hardest content, which *wastes bandwidth* on easy content ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9Cone,specified%20by%20the%20ladder%20above)). Alternatively, if tuned lower, it saves bandwidth but lets quality drop on demanding scenes. Netflix engineers found that with a static ladder, some noisy or action-heavy titles still showed artifacts at the highest fixed bitrate, while for simple titles the top bitrate was “far more than needed” to achieve excellent quality ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9Cone,specified%20by%20the%20ladder%20above)). Thus, static encoding often either *under-delivers quality or over-allocates bitrate*. This translates to a poorer overall quality-to-bit ratio across a catalog. As a result, most major VOD platforms have moved away from pure static recipes in favor of content-adaptive methods that improve efficiency ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=Emergence%20of%20per)).

## Brute-Force Per-Title Encoding (Exhaustive Testing)
**Description:** *Brute-force per-title encoding* refers to encoding each video asset multiple times with different parameter settings or bitrates, measuring the quality of each result (using metrics like **VMAF** or PSNR), and choosing the optimal settings for that specific asset. Essentially, it’s an exhaustive trial-and-error search for the best encode. Netflix’s well-known **Per-Title Encoding Optimization** (introduced in 2015) is a prime example: Netflix encodes each source video into *hundreds of resolution/bitrate combinations* to empirically determine the optimal bitrate ladder for that title ([

By plotting objective quality vs. bitrate for many encodes, they find the *“convex hull”* – the most efficient set of streams that achieve the highest quality for the lowest bitrate at each resolution ([
	The Past, Present, and Future of Per-Title Encoding
](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=Netflix%20uses%20a%20brute,You%20see%20this%20in%C2%A0Figure%202)). Early on, Netflix used PSNR to evaluate these encodes, and later switched to their perceptual metric VMAF in 2016 for better correlation with viewer quality ([

](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=Interestingly%2C%20the%20metric%20that%20originally,with%20my%20use%20of%20VMAF)). The end result of this brute-force process is a custom ABR ladder tailored to each title’s complexity (e.g. a simple cartoon gets lower bitrates or fewer high-res streams, whereas an action movie gets higher bitrates to maintain quality) ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=This%20%E2%80%9Cone,specified%20by%20the%20ladder%20above)).

**Who Uses It:** This approach is used primarily by top-tier VOD streaming services that can afford the processing cost. **Netflix** pioneered it – they decided that for their relatively modest catalog (compared to user-upload platforms) with millions of viewers per title, an expensive encoding process was worthwhile to save bandwidth and improve quality ([
	The Past, Present, and Future of Per-Title Encoding
](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=detailed%20its%20approach,at%20the%20lowest%20possible%20bitrate)). Other premium services with large libraries of professionally curated content have followed with their own per-title methods. **Amazon Prime Video**, for instance, employs a form of content-adaptive encoding (“Defined Quality VBR”) which adjusts bitrate per scene to hit quality targets ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=To%20further%20optimize%20video%20quality,quality%20for%20a%20given%20bitrate)) – conceptually similar to per-title optimization (though Amazon’s exact workflow is less public, it aligns with the idea of ensuring each scene/title meets a quality bar efficiently). Many cloud encoding vendors (Bitmovin, AWS Elemental MediaConvert, Brightcove, Mux, etc.) now offer automated per-title encoding features so that even smaller providers can leverage this idea ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=Introducing%20Automated%20ABR%20Configuration)) ([

](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=Also%20in%202016%2C%20Capella%20Systems,encoding%20vendor%20Bitmovin)). However, a pure brute-force search (trying *every* combination) is **not** used by platforms that deal with massive volumes of user-generated content or live streams, because it’s extremely computationally heavy. For example, YouTube, which ingests hundreds of hours of video per minute, needed a *faster, less costly* approach – their researchers combined a quick complexity analysis (a single 240p CRF encode) with machine learning to predict the optimal ladder, rather than brute-forcing multiple full encodes for every video ([
	The Past, Present, and Future of Per-Title Encoding
](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20in%20early%202016%2C,encode%20of%20the%20source%20file)). In summary, exhaustive per-title encoding is mainly employed by large VOD services (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) and offered via encoding services for premium content, whereas platforms with *high volume or time-sensitive content* usually use more efficient shortcuts (heuristics or AI) to approximate the same results.

**Advantages:** The brute-force method produces *highly optimized results* for each video. It ensures that **each title gets the *minimum bitrate* needed for the desired quality**, eliminating the waste from a static approach ([Per-Title Encode Optimization. delivering the same or better… | by Netflix Technology Blog | Netflix TechBlog](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html#:~:text=Given%20this%20diversity%2C%20a%20one,perceptible%20improvement%20in%20video%20quality)). Viewers get better visual quality at a given bandwidth, or the same quality at lower bandwidth, which is a huge win for user experience and CDN costs. For instance, Netflix reported significant bandwidth savings with per-title encoding while delivering equal or better quality ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Implementing%20per,case%20for%20tailored%20encoding%20strategies)). This approach adapts to content characteristics: simple scenes won’t be over-encoded, and complex scenes get the bits they need. It’s very effective at dealing with a diverse catalog – from animation to grainy film, each gets a fitting recipe. Overall, brute-force per-title encoding maximizes quality consistency across a library; it meets objective quality targets (like a VMAF score) for each asset by picking the best encoding version of that asset. In practice, this means *improved average quality and fewer artifacts* for viewers, and often a reduction in total streaming bits delivered ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Implementing%20per,case%20for%20tailored%20encoding%20strategies)) ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=quality%2C%20each%20title%20needed%20its,prototype%20and%20build%20on%20AWS)).

**Drawbacks:** The clear downside is *cost and complexity*. Brute-force per-title encoding requires **multiple encodes of every video**, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Netflix noted that implementing per-title encoding meant re-encoding their entire catalog – a “massive computational undertaking” ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Implementing%20per,case%20for%20tailored%20encoding%20strategies)). Smaller providers might find this cost hard to justify, as the ROI depends on scale and bandwidth savings. The process also adds delay: encoding one asset in several different ways and analyzing quality takes longer than a single pass encode, which could slow down content publishing workflows. It’s generally unsuitable for live streaming or user-generated content platforms where speed is paramount. Moreover, developing and maintaining the quality evaluation and decision system adds complexity (Netflix had to develop metrics like VMAF and orchestration to automate choosing the best ladder ([

In short, brute-force per-title encoding trades a *huge increase in encoding time/compute* for bandwidth efficiency. Many services with vast content libraries (YouTube, Facebook) have determined that a full exhaustive approach per video is impractical for them ([

Even for those who use it, there’s ongoing work to *streamline the process* (reducing the number of test encodes needed) because of the heavy resource demand.

## Industry Adoption and Current Practices

**Major Streaming Platforms:** Virtually all leading streaming services have moved beyond static encoding in favor of content-adaptive approaches. Netflix famously *abandoned static recipes* in 2015 and rolled out per-title encoding, citing the inefficiencies of treating all videos the same ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Initially%2C%20Netflix%20employed%20a%20relatively,quality%20for%20the%20action%20movie)). They demonstrated how a show like *Bojack Horseman* (simple animation) could be encoded at much lower bitrate than *Stranger Things* (dark, complex scenes) with no quality loss – something impossible under a fixed ladder ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Initially%2C%20Netflix%20employed%20a%20relatively,quality%20for%20the%20action%20movie)). Netflix invested heavily in this per-title strategy (re-encoding their entire library) and saw major quality and bandwidth improvements ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Implementing%20per,case%20for%20tailored%20encoding%20strategies)). Not stopping there, Netflix later introduced **per-shot (scene-by-scene) encoding** in 2018 to squeeze even more efficiency by adjusting parameters for each scene ([
	The Past, Present, and Future of Per-Title Encoding
](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=Per)) ([
	The Past, Present, and Future of Per-Title Encoding
](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=Intuitively%2C%20scene,while%20retaining%20the%20same%20quality)). In other words, Netflix now uses highly content-aware methods and even dynamic optimizations within each title, far from any static approach. 

YouTube also employs content-aware encoding, but approached the problem differently due to scale. With thousands of user uploads per minute, YouTube couldn’t afford to brute-force every video. Instead, they developed a faster prediction-based per-title system. A 2016 research paper from YouTube described using a single low-resolution test encode plus **machine learning** to predict the best encoding settings for a video ([
	The Past, Present, and Future of Per-Title Encoding
](https://www.streamingmedia.com/Articles/Editorial/Featured-Articles/The-Past-Present-and-Future-of-Per-Title-Encoding-147705.aspx#:~:text=In%20contrast%2C%20in%20early%202016%2C,encode%20of%20the%20source%20file)). This allowed YouTube to adjust encoding per content *without* testing hundreds of encodes for each. Thus, while YouTube’s pipeline does generate a fixed set of resolutions, the bitrate allocation and other parameters can be tuned based on content complexity signals (rather than strictly one-size-fits-all). The result is a more efficient ladder per video, achieved in a computationally tractable way. In summary, YouTube is content-adaptive in practice, even if via smarter analysis rather than brute force.

Amazon Prime Video similarly utilizes content-aware encoding techniques. Amazon has mentioned using a **“Defined Quality Variable Bitrate (DQVBR)”** encoding mode – essentially adjusting the bitrate to maintain a defined quality level for each scene ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=To%20further%20optimize%20video%20quality,quality%20for%20a%20given%20bitrate)). This means Prime Video’s encoding will give difficult scenes more bits and easy scenes fewer, ensuring consistent quality. It’s a form of per-title/per-scene optimization that aligns with the industry trend. Amazon’s AWS Elemental encoding division has even productized per-title encoding (via *Automated ABR* in MediaConvert) so that others can easily get a unique ladder per video based on complexity analysis ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=AWS%20Elemental%20MediaConvert%2C%20which%20allows,ABR%20configuration%20of%20each%20video)). In fact, AWS notes that a one-size-fits-all ladder “results in inefficient...and less than optimal video quality,” and touts that now *anyone* can have per-title optimization similar to Netflix’s, using their cloud tools ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=How%20many%20renditions%20should%20you,usage%20of%20your%20video%20content)) ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=quality%2C%20each%20title%20needed%20its,prototype%20and%20build%20on%20AWS)).

**Other Services:** Most other major OTT services (e.g. **Disney+**, **Hulu**, **HBO Max**) are not as public about their encoding practices, but it’s broadly understood that content-aware encoding is standard for high-end VOD. These platforms typically either build on the state-of-the-art ideas (many hire encoding experts who know Netflix’s methods) or use commercial encoding solutions that offer per-title optimizations. It’s unlikely that any large-scale subscription streaming service today is still using a naive static ladder for all content – the competitive need to minimize bandwidth costs and maximize quality pushed the industry toward per-title approaches. For example, Brightcove (a video platform provider used by many media companies) introduced a **Context Aware Encoding** feature that customizes ladders per content back in the mid-2010s, and others like Bitmovin did the same ([

Even consumer platforms like **Vimeo** and **JW Player** adopted simpler forms of content-adaptivity (using capped CRF encoding) to automatically give each upload an appropriate bitrate ladder ([

That said, **static encoding settings remain in use in certain segments.** As noted, a sizeable portion of streaming industry respondents have not yet implemented content-adaptive encoding, often citing *cost or complexity constraints* ([Bitmovin Video Developer Report Reveals Streaming in 2025: Incremental Growth Over Innovation - Streaming Learning Center](https://streaminglearningcenter.com/learning/bitmovin-report-reveals-streaming-in-2025-incremental-growth-over-innovation.html#:~:text=As%20you%20probably%20know%2C%20per,a%20lack%20of%20perceived%20ROI)). Smaller content distributors or those with relatively uniform content libraries might stick to a fixed recipe, at least until they can justify a change. There is a trade-off calculus: if a service has only a small library or already streams at very conservative quality levels, the savings from per-title may not outweigh the engineering effort. Additionally, live streaming channels often still use fixed (or lightly tuned) ladders, because performing per-title analysis on a live feed is impractical. Instead, live broadcasters might use newer encoders with *real-time* content-aware rate control (for instance, AWS’s QVBR or Harmonic’s EyeQ which automatically vary bitrate with scene complexity) ([

For user-generated content platforms, a full brute-force approach is generally too costly, so they either use static settings as a baseline and then apply selective enhancements for top content (Facebook, for example, quickly encodes uploads at standard settings and later re-encodes popular videos with better codecs or slower presets to improve compression ([How Facebook encodes your videos - Engineering at Meta](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/04/05/video-engineering/how-facebook-encodes-your-videos/#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20once%20a%20video%20is,how%20much%20computing%20power%20is))). In summary, **static encoding persists mainly due to resource constraints or real-time requirements, while brute-force per-title is employed when quality and efficiency must be maximized and the content volume is manageable.**

## Evolution: Content-Aware and AI-Based Encoding Strategies
Both static and brute-force approaches are being overtaken by smarter, more *content-aware* techniques, often aided by AI. The brute-force per-title method itself proved that tailoring encodes to content yields big benefits, but it’s being refined to avoid its heavy cost. Modern encoding pipelines increasingly use *analysis-driven* encoding: instead of blindly trying many encodes, they analyze video complexity metrics up front to make informed decisions. For instance, many per-title systems today do a quick complexity scan (or a single test encode) to estimate how difficult a video is to compress, and from that deduce the optimal encoding ladder – drastically cutting down the number of trial encodes needed ([

This is a more efficient variant of the brute-force idea, often called **“content-adaptive encoding.”** Netflix’s own workflow has evolved with this principle: their *Dynamic Optimizer* in 2018 took per-title to the next level by analyzing video shots and applying different encoding parameters per scene, yielding over 20–30% bitrate savings on top of per-title, at the same quality ([

They achieved this by intelligently detecting scene changes and complexity, not by brute-forcing every possible segment. Others are incorporating machine learning to guide encoding decisions. Researchers from Fraunhofer, for example, demonstrated ML models that predict the best encoding settings for each scene or title, to “*avoid hundreds of encodes* while determining the best way to encode video assets” ([Per-Title Encoding Archives – The Broadcast Knowledge](https://thebroadcastknowledge.com/tag/per-title-encoding/#:~:text=AI%E2%80%99s%20continues%20its%20march%20into,way%20to%20encode%20video%20assets)). These AI approaches learn from data to directly estimate the relationship between content features and the needed bitrate/quality, essentially automating what an exhaustive search would find, but much faster.

Looking ahead, **AI-driven encoding** is poised to play a larger role. Companies like Netflix and Twitch have explicitly mentioned exploring AI-powered encoding strategies that can analyze a video and output optimal encoding parameters (resolution, bitrate, codec choice) *per scene or title* ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=The%20Future%3A%20AI%20in%20Encoding)). Such systems could consider not just the pixel complexity but also things like perceptual importance of scenes, or even viewer device/network statistics, to make encoding even more efficient. An example of this broader context awareness is Brightcove’s work on using playback data (device types, network speeds of viewers) in combination with content complexity to design encoding ladders ([

All these trends indicate that the industry is moving toward **smarter, adaptive encoding** at every level. Static ladders are largely legacy or fallback solutions now, and even the brute-force per-title approach is being optimized by analytical and AI techniques that achieve similar results with less redundancy.

In conclusion, **static encoding and brute-force per-title encoding represent two extremes** on the spectrum of video encoding strategies. Static settings offer simplicity but at the cost of efficiency, and were once widespread; now, major streaming platforms have largely phased them out in favor of content-aware methods. Brute-force per-title encoding offers excellent quality optimization and is used by leaders like Netflix for VOD content, but it’s resource-intensive. In practice, this approach is being augmented (and in some cases replaced) by more intelligent, content-aware workflows – from per-title algorithms that use quick complexity metrics, to per-scene optimizations, to AI predictions of the best settings. **The dominant trend** across the industry is toward *tailored encoding per content*, whether via brute force or smarter analysis, because it delivers tangible bandwidth savings and better viewer experience ([Encode video in a smarter way using Automated ABR | AWS for M&E Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/introducing-automated-abr-adaptive-bit-rate-configuration-a-better-way-to-encode-vod-content-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert/#:~:text=quality%2C%20each%20title%20needed%20its,prototype%20and%20build%20on%20AWS)) ([Video Encoding: The First Step in Streaming Success](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/video-encoding-first-step-streaming-success-anton-gavrailov#:~:text=Implementing%20per,case%20for%20tailored%20encoding%20strategies)). Still, the adoption of these advanced techniques varies: top-tier platforms and many OTT services leverage them heavily, while some smaller or live-focused services stick with simpler static methods due to cost or latency constraints ([Bitmovin Video Developer Report Reveals Streaming in 2025: Incremental Growth Over Innovation - Streaming Learning Center](https://streaminglearningcenter.com/learning/bitmovin-report-reveals-streaming-in-2025-incremental-growth-over-innovation.html#:~:text=The%20Report%20shows%20that%2025.5,a%20divide%20in%20the%20industry)) ([

As computational power becomes cheaper and tools more accessible, content-adaptive encoding (potentially AI-driven) is expected to increasingly supplant one-size-fits-all pipelines, ensuring that both simple cartoons and complex action films are streamed in the most efficient way possible.
